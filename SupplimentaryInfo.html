      <p>Putting a good spin on work is wise, if not expected, in the profession world. 
       However, being with a medical rehab team has taught me that <b>in this situation</b>
       to be transparent with my progress with Netplay as I <b>recover my capabilities</b> is more important 
       than it otherwise might be.  I will therefore openly declare how much I have achieved
       (or not achieved) and trust that you will see this as a way of identifying anything
       I might need to brush up on.  </p>
      
      <p>Fortunately the new paradigms and principles are now firmly fixed in my mind.  I do not have 
      any problems understanding any of it or remembering the new concepts and implementations.  
      The challenge will be the management of the tasks.  By analogy I now understand Special relativity
      again (from my Physics), but I would have to look up how integrate using 4-vectors several 
      times before it sticks.  </p>
      
       <p>Unfortunately to cut a long story short, I have to rate myself at only about 5 out ot 10.  
       Almost all of the time has been spend on researching, and trying the technologies mentioned 
       in the brief.  I do not how much I knew before the injury, but everything was new to me, 
       so I needed to read up and try out everything.  This will <b>not need to happen again</b>.</p>
       
       <p>Please know that normally I would see the delivery of the work with all the bells and whistles on time as 
       of primary importance.  I have been doing the research and trying the technologies mentioned in the brief, and 
       learning new techniques for almost all the time given.  I have found online many time saving tools to help me 
       in the future.</p>
      
      <p><b>Please bare in mind that I will not need to do this again.  </b></p>
